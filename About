# Game of Nim
Nim is a mathematical game where two players take turns removing "objects" from a pile. Each turn they must remove at least one item, but at most half of the pile. Whoever removes the last marvel loses.  

I made this project during my first computer science course at Red Rocks Community College during July of 2021.
